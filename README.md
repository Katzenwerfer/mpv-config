# Katzenwerfer's mpv config

This is just an archive of my current mpv setings, plugins, shaders, etc.

## Notes

This config was tested in Windows 10

Most of the stuff I use (shaders, flags,...) require a considerably good hardware

### This [config](https://github.com/Tsubajashi/mpv-settings) could be better for general use. Mine is more of a personal use case :p
