# Katzenwerfer's [mpv player](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) config

This is just an archive of my current mpv setings, plugins, shaders, etc.

If you want to use it make sure to review it and change it according to your setup.

## Notes

This config was mostly tested in Windows 11.

I use my own builds

Recommended [MPV build](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/64bit/) (download latest)

Alternative [MPV build](https://jeremylee.sh/bins/mpv.7z)

Also a [cool font](https://github.com/Genbuchan/KarasumaGothic) that I use for the whole UI

Most of the stuff I use require a considerably good hardware.

### This [config](https://github.com/Tsubajashi/mpv-settings) could be better for general use. Mine is more of a personal archive :p
