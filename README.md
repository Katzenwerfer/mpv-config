# Katzenwerfer's mpv config

This is just an archive of my current mpv setings, plugins, shaders, etc.

If you want to use it make sure to change any system specific settings.

## Notes

This config was tested in Windows 10

Recommended [MPV build](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/64bit/mpv-x86_64-20211107-git-ec16769.7z/download)

Most of the stuff I use (shaders, flags,...) require a considerably good hardware

### This [config](https://github.com/Tsubajashi/mpv-settings) could be better for general use. Mine is more of a personal archive :p
