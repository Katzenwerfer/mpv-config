# Katzenwerfer's [mpv player](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) config

This is just an archive of my current mpv setings, plugins, shaders, etc.

If you want to use it make sure to review it and change it according to your setup.

## Notes

This config was mostly tested in Windows 11.

I use my own builds

Recommended [MPV build](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/64bit/) (download latest)

Alternative [MPV build](https://jeremylee.sh/bins/mpv.7z)

I like using [Karasuma Gothic](https://github.com/Genbuchan/KarasumaGothic) or [Monocraft](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft) for the UI

Most of the stuff I use require a considerably good hardware.
